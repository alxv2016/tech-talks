# Tech Talks landing page
This landing page was designed and created by me for a platform to promote design & tech talks and workshops for designers in my studio.
The landing page was built with the Angular 11 along with GSAP for the scroll trigger animations. All powered by a headless cms for content management.

## Demo
You can view the demo here:
[TechTalks](https://techtalks.alxvtoronto.com/)

## Take aways
1. Create a scroll trigger landing page in Angular
2. Using GSAP animation the "Angular way"
3. Connect a project to a headless CMS [directus](https://directus.io/)
4. Dynamically injecting content from a rest api
5. Submit and validate a user sign up form through api

## Libraries used
To keep it lean only a handful of external libraries were used
1. GSAP - [gsap](https://greensock.com/gsap/)
2. Angular - [angular](https://angular.io/)

## Dev and Build scripts
```
ng serve
```
```
ng build --prod
```

All images and assets/content are created by Alex Vong (me), this project was built with passion and was used as base of refreshing my angular dev knowledge.
